migrate to store the password rest tokens

php artisan migrate
php artisan make:auth
Laravel will generate all of the necessary views for password reset when the make:auth command is executed

1.  Send the reset link to the user
    public function sendPasswordResetNotification($token)
    {
        $this->notify(new ResetPasswordNotification($token));
    }

    After Resetting the password, we need to redirect to login or dashboard
    protected $redirectTo = '/dashboard';

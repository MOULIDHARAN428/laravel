   php artisan env:decrypt --key=3UVsEgGVK36XN82KKeyLFMhvosbZN1aF ;

8. php artisan config:cache : caching configuration files, it will boost the speed of the application

9. While maintainance of the server, we can do "php artisan down", which makes the applications disable while we updating.
   we can have php artisan down --secret="1630542a-246b-4b66-afa1-dd72a4c43515", a secret key will byepass the maintainance,
   we can redirect to any pages php artisan down --redirect=/ or we could show error messages.

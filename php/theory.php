    // PHP4 doesn't support oops concept and uses Zend Engine 1.
    // PHP5 supports oops concept and uses Zend Engine 2.
    // The scripting engine that powers PHP is called Zend Engine 2.

    //  Echo can output one or more string but print can only output one string and always returns 1.
    // Echo is faster than print because it does not return any value.

    // magic constants are declared with __ in the front
    // __CLASS__ for example
